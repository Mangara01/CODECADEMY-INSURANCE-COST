# Predicting Insurance Costs with PyCaret

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting insurance costs using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library. PyCaret simplifies the end-to-end machine learning process, from data preparation to model deployment. The goal of this project is to estimate the cost of health insurance for individuals by leveraging PyCaret's capabilities.

## Key Feature

In the us_medical_insurance_costs.ipynb notebook, you will find PyCaret code for:

* Setting up PyCaret environment.
* Preprocessing the data using PyCaret's automated features.
* Building, evaluating, and comparing multiple machine learning models with minimal code.

## File Description
  
### us_medical_insurance_costs.ipynb:

This notebook contains code to build the machine learning.

### insurance.csv:

This csv file contains data for analysis.
